- Capture screenshots of websites and save them as inspirations
- Organize inspirations within projects
- View and edit project and inspiration details

## Technology Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS Modules
- React Router
- IndexedDB (via idb library)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

1. **Node.js** (version 18.20.2)
   - Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)
   - Verify installation: `npm --version`

3. **Git**
   - Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Verify installation: `git --version`

3. **Docker**
   - Download and install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)
   - Verify installation: `docker --version`

## Getting Started (web App)

1. Fork the repository:
   - Visit the GitHub repository
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the repository

2. Clone your forked repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/page-prism.git
   cd page-prism
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

6. Run tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This will run all the tests in the project using Jest.

7. Run tests in watch mode (for development):
   ```
   npm test -- --watch
   ```

   This will run Jest in watch mode, which will re-run tests when files change.

## Getting Started (genAI)

1. Pull and run docker image
   - `docker pull ollama/ollama`
   - `docker run -it -v ~/ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama`
   - `docker exec -it ollama ollama run tinyllama`

2. Test API server
   - `curl -v --location 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"model": "tinyllama","prompt": "why is the sky blue?", "stream": true}'`

## Project Structure

- `/src`: Source code
  - `/components`: Reusable React components
  - `/layouts`: Layout components
  - `/pages`: Page components
  - `/services`: API and data services
  - `/utils`: Utility functions
  - `/models`: TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `/hooks`: Custom React hooks

## Additional Notes

- The project uses IndexedDB for local storage, simulating a backend database
- API calls can be mocked with artificial latency to simulate network requests

## Additional Setup

- **VS Code Extensions** (optional but recommended):
  - ESLint
  - Prettier

- **Environment Setup**:
  - This project uses Node.js version 18.20.2. To ensure you're using the correct version, you can use a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager):
    ```
    nvm use
    ```
  - If you don't have `nvm` installed, you can get it from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

- **Editor Configuration**:
  - The project includes a `.prettierrc` file for consistent code formatting. Make sure your editor is set up to use Prettier for formatting.
